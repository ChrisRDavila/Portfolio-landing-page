    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I spent my formative years in California where I developed a love for the ocean dunes and temperate climate. Firfteen years in Portland, Oregon still havn't really acclimated me to the lack of sun and constant rain. I finished High school and spent some time after in Junior colleges on the coast chasing an engineering degree before settling in Portland and deciding to work in some amazing kitchens and bar tending when required.  I love cuisine and travel, I spent around five months travelling cross country and trying whatever regional dishes I could based on blogs and searches in attempt to summise what area of the states had the best food. I like writing music and singing karaoke on my off days, and i love to hike.  Ive made it my goal to visit as many national parks as I can, and I can boast that Ive already made it to most of the major parks in the continental US. Im back in California now but plan to return to the PNW at a later date, pending a career change. I decided to join Epicodus because after the pandemic I had a chance to re-evaluate my life and some financial freedom. Instead of trying to just get through to the next week in the constant flow of daily life, the Pandemic break gave me a chance to see that my current trajectory was unsustainable. Good pay at some servie industry jobs requires odd hours and i did not want to go into my forties working until 5am everyday. Epicodus gives me the oppurtunity to enter a new field thats exciting, allows for lots of growth and fits my goals and lifestyle at this point of my journey.</p>
