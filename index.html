    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I spent my formative years in California where I developed a love for the ocean dunes and temperate climate. Firfteen years in Portland, Oregon still havn't really acclimated me to the lack of sun and constant rain. I finished High school and spent some time after in Junior colleges on the coast chasing an engineering degree before settling in Portland and deciding to work in some amazing kitchens and bar tending when required.  I love cuisine and travel, I spent around five months travelling cross country and trying whatever regional dishes I could based on blogs and searches in attempt to summise what area of the states had the best food. I like writing music and singing karaoke on my off days, and i love to hike.  Ive made it my goal to visit as many national parks as I can, and I can boast that Ive already made it to most of the major parks in the continental US. Im back in California now but plan to return to the PNW at a later date, pending a career change.</p>
